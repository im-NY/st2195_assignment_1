<ol>
 <li>a read.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment [1 mark]</li>
 <li>a folder called "r_studio" with an R-studio project containing an R script that prints all integers 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10) to screen [1 point - an extra point is awarded if this is done with a for loop]</li>
 <li>a folder called “spyder” with a Spyder project containing a Python script that prints all integers between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10) to screen [1 point – an extra point is awarded if this done with a for loop]</li>
